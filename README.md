it allows the user to configure local storage, network storage and ftp storage for backups and a maximum age (in days) before autodeleting

the script can be run using 

python hyperv-backup.py

all configurable settings are located in the Setting section of the script. All are marked with '*change values*'

The configurable values include:

The backups can be configured using the vms.ini
